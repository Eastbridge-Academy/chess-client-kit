"""Your evaluation function.

``evaluate(board)`` returns a centipawn score for the given position, from
White's point of view: positive means White is winning, negative means
Black is winning, zero means the position is even. Your bot calls this
function from ``bot.py`` to compare candidate moves; Phase 5's search code
will call it at the leaves of its lookahead tree.

Phase 4 builds this up incrementally: material counting, piece-square
tables, mobility, and any extra features you want to add for personality.
The kit ships canonical starting values for piece values and PSTs in
``chessdk`` that you may import and tune.
